# DesignPatterns_Java
Design Patterns are very popular among software developers. A design
pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.
Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:
#1. Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard
approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly
use the design pattern.
#2. Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to
more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total
cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
#3. Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to
understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new
members of team understand it easily.

#There are five creational design patterns:
#1. Singleton Pattern
#2. Factory Pattern
#3. Abstract Factory Pattern
#4. Builder Pattern
#5. Prototype Pattern
